# POLLUTION-MEASUREMENT
This is Deep learning Concept project. The main objective was to make an accurate assessment of pollution levels, pollution vehicles and develop water sprinkling and techniques to estimate pollution loads in each city.
We have used large datasets (images of different plant leaves) to find accurate pollution measurements. Weâ€™ve used a dataset (plant leaves) from different parts of India.
