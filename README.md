# POLLUTION-MEASUREMENT
This Work give us an overview of our project Pollution Measurement from Dust over Road Side Plant Leaf. The main objective was to make an accurate assessment of pollution levels, pollution vehicles and develop water sprinkling and techniques to estimate pollution loads in each city.
The evaluation process that we followed to evaluate our concepts and techniques that we applied in order to choose our final concept.
We have used large datasets (images of different plant leaves) to find accurate pollution measurements. Weâ€™ve used a dataset (plant leaves) from different parts of India. We use Keras library to generate/Augment image.
We train sequential model to find pollution in road side. Till now, Accuracy is 73%.
